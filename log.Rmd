# Quality control using ASCII
To assess the quality of the sequencing-data, the Phred quality score was calculated.
For each base a quality ASCII symbol was given. By converting this symbol to it's original ASCII value and subtracting 33 (as per standard for Illumina sequencing), the Numerical Score was calculated using R, as can be seen in Table 1. Based on this Numerical Score a Base call accuracy was calculated using the following formula: $1-10^{(-N/10)}$ where N is the Numerical Score. Based on this Base call accuracy the certainty of the precence of the base is determend. So for example the third base in Table 1 is a C, for cytosine. It has a accuracy of 0.9987 which means that it is 99,87% certain that the cytosine detected is actualy a cytosine and not another base. 

```{r FASTQ ASCII Quality calculator, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Base = c("N","T","C","A","T","G","T","A","C","G") #Bases as given
Quality_CHAR = c("#",">",">","1","A","1","B","3","B","1") #Qualitiy CHAR as given
Quality_STRING = paste0("#",">",">","1","A","1","B","3","B","1") #The Qualitiy CHAR stored differend
ASCII = utf8ToInt(Quality_STRING) #Converting the Quality string to ASCII-values
Numerical_Score = ASCII-33 #Subtracting 33 from the ASCII-values as per standard for Illumina
Base_call_accuracy = round(1-(10**((-Numerical_Score)/10)), digits = 4) #Calculating Phred quality score and rounding it to 4 digits
```
